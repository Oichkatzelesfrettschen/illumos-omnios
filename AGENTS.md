Coding Conventions
------------------
- All modified files must use modern idiomatic style and be fully commented for Doxygen.
- Decompose, unroll, flatten, and factor logic where practical during edits.
- Document purpose, parameters, returns, and globals for each function using `///` or `/** */`.
- Ensure build scripts list dependencies for Doxygen, Sphinx, Breathe, CLOC, qemu, and tmux.
